# Degen Gaming ERC20 Token Project

Welcome to the Degen Gaming ERC20 Token Project! In this project, we aim to create and deploy an ERC20 token on the Avalanche network to enhance the gaming experience for players.

## Overview

Degen Gaming is a gaming platform that integrates blockchain technology to offer players a unique and rewarding gaming experience. By deploying an ERC20 token on the Avalanche network, we aim to introduce a decentralized in-game economy that empowers players with various functionalities.

## Token Functionalities

Our ERC20 token offers the following key functionalities:

1. **Minting New Tokens**: Only the platform owner can mint new tokens, allowing for the distribution of rewards to players for their achievements and contributions.

2. **Transferring Tokens**: Players have the ability to transfer their tokens to other players, fostering a vibrant player-to-player economy within the gaming ecosystem.

3. **Redeeming Tokens**: Tokens can be redeemed for exclusive in-game items available in the Degen Gaming store, enhancing the gaming experience for players.

4. **Checking Token Balance**: Players can conveniently check their token balance at any time, ensuring transparency and trust in the token economy.

5. **Burning Tokens**: Unused tokens can be burned by anyone, helping maintain a healthy token economy by reducing token supply when necessary.

## Deployment

The ERC20 token has been deployed on the Avalanche network, specifically on the Fuji Testnet, to ensure a seamless integration with the Degen Gaming platform. Players can interact with the token using compatible wallets and decentralized applications (DApps) on the Avalanche network.
